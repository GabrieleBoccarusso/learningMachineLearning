# Machine Learning by Gabriele Boccarusso

The repository with all the files that I used to learn machine learning.
<br> The first step is to set up the environment. If you have windows you can follow
<br> my article: [Setting up a python machine learning environment on windows](https://dev.to/gabrieleboccarusso/setting-up-a-python-machine-learning-environment-on-windows-2hfi)
<br> in the data folder you can find every csv that I have ever used,
<br> now are all in one folder but in the future they will be more organized.
